## The Book List

Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!

- Create a webpage with an h1 of "My Book List".
- Create a new Javascript file and link to it with a script tag at the bottom.
- Copy this array of books:
```javascript
var books = [
  {title: 'The Design of EveryDay Things',
   author: 'Don Norman',
   alreadyRead: false
  },
  {title: 'The Most Human Human',
  author: 'Brian Christian',
  alreadyRead: true
  }];
```
- Iterate through the array of books. For each book, create a p element with the book title and author and append it to the page.
- Bonus: Use a ul and li to display the books.
- Bonus: add a property to each book with the URL of the book cover, and add an img element for each book on the page.
- Bonus: Change the style of the book depending on whether you have read it or not.
