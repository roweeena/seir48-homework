                She became the Chief of the Programming Research Branch, Applied Mathematics Laboratory at the David Taylor Model Basin in 1959, helped to develop UNIVAC, wrote the first generative programming system (SORT/MERGE), and the first statistical analysis package
                for the 1950 U.S. Census.

                Holberton worked with John Mauchly to develop the C-10 instructions for BINAC (generally considered to be the origins of modern programming languages), and also worked with Grace Hopper in the early standards of COBOL and FORTRAN. Not only did Holberton
                create commands, but she was also responsible for developing the numeric keypad and for making computers that awful beige color.

                In 1997, Holberton and the other five original ENIAC programmers were inducted into the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame. Holberton was the only woman of the original six ENIAC programmers to receive the Augusta Ada Lovelace Award, also
                in 1997.
