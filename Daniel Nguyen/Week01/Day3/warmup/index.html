    <p>Day 3 Warmup</p>
    <p>
    ## Warmup - Raindrops

    Write a Javascript program that will take a number (eg 28 or 1755 or 9, etc) and output the following:

    - If the number contains 3 as a factor, output 'Pling'.
    - If the number contains 5 as a factor, output 'Plang'.
    - If the number contains 7 as a factor, output 'Plong'.
    - If the number does not contain 3, 5 or 7 as a factor, output the number as a string.

    ### Examples

    - 28 has 7 as a factor.
      - In raindrop-speak, this would be a simple "Plong".
    - 1755 has 3 and 5 as factors.
      - In raindrop-speak, this would be a "PlingPlang".
    - 34 has neither 3, 5 nor 7 as a factor.
      - Raindrop-speak doesn't know what to make of that, so it just goes with the straightforward "34".</p>
