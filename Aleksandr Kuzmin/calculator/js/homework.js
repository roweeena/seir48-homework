// # The Calculator
//
// ## Part 1
// - Write a function called squareNumber that will take one argument (a number),
//  square that number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."
// - Write a function called halfNumber that will take one argument (a number),
//divide it by 2, and return the result. It should also log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".
// - Write a function called percentOf that will take two numbers, figure out what percent the first number
// represents of the second number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."
// - Write a function called areaOfCircle that will take one argument (the radius),
//calculate the area based on that, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The area for a circle with radius 2 is 12.566370614359172."
// - Bonus: Round the result so there are only two digits after the decimal.

// ## Part 2
// Write a function that will take one argument (a number) and perform the following operations, using the functions you wrote earlier1:
// - Take half of the number and store the result.
// - Square the result of #1 and store that result.
// - Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius.
// - Calculate what percentage that area is of the squared result (#3).

  console.log (halfNumber,squaredNum,areaOfSquaredNum,percenfOfArea);
