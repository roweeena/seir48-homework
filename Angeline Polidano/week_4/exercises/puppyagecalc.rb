## The Puppy Age Calculator
#
# You know how old your dog is in human years, but what about dog years? Calculate it!
#
# Write a function named calculateDogAge that:
# - takes 1 argument: your puppy's age.
# - calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.
# - outputs the result to the screen like so: "Your doggie is NN years old in dog years!"
# - Call the function three times with different sets of values.
# - Bonus: Add an additional argument to the function that takes the conversion rate of human to dog years.


def puppies_age ('a')

human_years = dog years / 7

dog_years = human_years *  7

puts "Your doggie is #{} in "
