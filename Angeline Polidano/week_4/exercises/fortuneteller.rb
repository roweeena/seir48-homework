# ## The Fortune Teller
#
# Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?
#
# Write a function named tellFortune that:
# - takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
# - outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
# - Call that function 4 times with 4 different values for the arguments.
