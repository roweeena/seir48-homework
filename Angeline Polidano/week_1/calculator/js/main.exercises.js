// # The Calculator

// ## Part 1
// - Write a function called squareNumber that will take one argument (a number), square that number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."

//return results

const squareNumber = function (numbera, numberb) {
  const answer = (numbera * numberb);
  console.log(`The result of squaring the number ${ numbera } is ${ answer}`);

};
squareNumber(3, 3);


// - Write a function called halfNumber that will take one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and return the result. It should also log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".

const halfNumber = function (arg1, arg2) {
   const answer = (arg1 / arg2);
   console.log (`Half of ${ arg1 } is ${ answer }`);

};
halfNumber(5, 2);


// - Write a function called percentOf that will take two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."

const percentOf = function (num1, num2) {
  const answer =
console.log(``)
  2 = 50%
  4 = 100%
}


// - Write a function called areaOfCircle that will take one argument (the radius), calculate the area based on that, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The area for a circle with radius 2 is 12.566370614359172."
// - Bonus: Round the result so there are only two digits after the decimal.

// ## Part 2
// Write a function that will take one argument (a number) and perform the following operations, using the functions you wrote earlier1:
// - Take half of the number and store the result.
// - Square the result of #1 and store that result.
// - Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius.
// - Calculate what percentage that area is of the squared result (#3).
