# Linked Lists Exercise

Complete the methods and classes defined in `LinkedList.js` according to the specifications in the comments. You can automatically test your progress by running `npm install` inside this folder to install the automated testing libraries, then run `npm test` to see if your functions pass the test cases.

> **Note:** The myGA module links out to CodePen for a code challenge for a linked list. **This exercise is the same as the one here and is meant to help you prepare for the in-class exercise.**
