# Divide and Conquer Sorts Exercises

## Overview
There are two exercises to help you practice what you learned in the Divide andConquer Sorts lesson. We'll impelment the two sorting algorithms!
* `MergeSort.js`
* `QuickSort.js`

This folder also contains test scripts that you can use on your code.

Make sure that you completed the myGA module for Divide and Conquer Sorts (link) before completing these exercises.

> NOTE: the myGA module links out to a Codepen for code challenges for both merge sort and quick sort. **Those exercises are the same as the ones here, and are meant to help you prepare for the in class exercises.**

## Tips
In the `MergeSort.js` exercise, you have code for the merge helper algorithm. So really, you're just implementing the merge sort algorithm!
